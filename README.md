 Overview
The project involves:
 Cleaning and preprocessing customer data.
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships.
 Handling class imbalance issues.
 Building and evaluating machine learning models.

 Tech Stack
 Python 3
 Pandas, NumPy
 Matplotlib, Seaborn
 Scikit-learn
 Jupyter Notebook

Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git

2. Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook
   jupyter notebook
4. Open analysis.ipynb and run all cells.

Project Workflow
Data Loading: Import and inspect customer data.
Data Cleaning: Remove irrelevant features, handle missing values.
EDA: Visualize numerical and categorical features.
Model Building: Train classification models to predict churn.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

Results
Key insights from the analysis:
 Imbalanced target classes identified and handled.
 Important features impacting churn determined during EDA.
 Model performance evaluated for business understanding.
