## Overview
The project involves:
- Cleaning and preprocessing customer data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships.
- Handling class imbalance issues.
- Building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `analysis.ipynb` and run all cells.

## Project Workflow
- **Data Loading**: Import and inspect customer data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove irrelevant features, handle missing values.
- **EDA**: Visualize numerical and categorical features.
- **Model Building**: Train classification models to predict churn.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

## Results
Key insights from the analysis:
- Imbalanced target classes identified and handled.
- Important features impacting churn determined during EDA.
- Model performance evaluated for business understanding.

*(You can add final model accuracy and a confusion matrix image if available!)*
