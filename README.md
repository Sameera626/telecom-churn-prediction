## Overview
The project involves:
- Cleaning and preprocessing customer data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships.
- Handling class imbalance issues.
- Building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Dataset
You can download the dataset from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

After downloading, place the file (e.g., `customer_data.csv`) inside the project folder before running the notebooks.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
   ```

2. **Download the Dataset**
   - [Download the dataset here](https://your-dataset-link.com).
   - Save it into the project directory (e.g., same folder as your notebook).

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   
5. Open `analysis.ipynb` and run all cells.

## Project Workflow
- **Data Loading**: Import and inspect customer data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove irrelevant features, handle missing values.
- **EDA**: Visualize and understand relationships between features.
- **Model Building**: Train classification models to predict churn (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Results
Key insights from the analysis:
- Imbalanced target classes were identified and addressed using resampling techniques.
- Important features impacting churn (such as tenure, contract type, monthly charges) were determined during EDA.
- Models were evaluated, and the best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **X%** (replace with your actual accuracy).
  
*(Optional: You can insert confusion matrix images or model comparison charts here.)*
